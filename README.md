# An Audio morse code translator

This is a small audio morse code encoder. 
You write your sentence in a console and then it's "translate".
But, it's only an audio encoder, there is no audio decoder (except your ear).
It works with the Oto low-level library : https://github.com/ebitengine/oto

My main.go is just a "fork" of the oto exemple : https://github.com/ebitengine/oto/blob/main/example/main.go
I modified the oto exemple to achieve my purpose.
