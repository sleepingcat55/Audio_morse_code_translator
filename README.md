# An Audio morse code translator

This is a small audio morse code encoder. It encore your sentence that you write in a console
It works with the Oto low-level library : https://github.com/ebitengine/oto

My main.go is just a "morse code fork" of the oto exemple : https://github.com/ebitengine/oto/blob/main/example/main.go
